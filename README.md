**If following the process is lengthy and the storage is too much for you to download, and Node.js is not installed on your system
You could paste the following link in your browser:**
```powershell
https://ecowaste-0vkj.onrender.com/
```
##Why does this link do the same as the process below?
This link is the link obtained by hosting the full GitHub repository on **Render**. 
The full backend is not required to manually install and run in PowerShell. Instead, it is auto-hosted on Render and the 
Backend and Database are always active. 
##Quick Start (Windows PowerShell)

### 1. Install Dependencies

```powershell
cd 'C:\Users\YOUR_PC_NAME\Desktop\YOUR_FOLDER_NAME'
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Server with Groq API (Required for AI Features)

This is the actual Groq API key: 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

```powershell
$env:GROQ_API_KEY = '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'
$env:GROQ_MODEL = 'groq/compound'
node server.js
```

**Example command:**
```powershell
$env:GROQ_API_KEY = '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'
$env:GROQ_MODEL = 'groq/compound'
node server.js
```
In the Case it does not work, you can create your own GroqAPI from 'console.groq.com'


### 3. Open in Browser

Once the server outputs Server running on http://localhost:LOCAL_SERVER_NUMBER, open your browser to:

```
http://localhost:LOCAL_SERVER_NUMBER/
```

##  Project File Structure & Functions

### **Frontend Files**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| index.html | **Homepage** – displays the EcoWaste logo, site name, recycling importance paragraph, and two interactive animated pie charts showing waste segregation statistics. |
| recycling-tips.html | **Recycling Tips Page** – contains educational tips and an AI-powered DIY suggester powered by Groq API (e.g., "How to recycle plastic bottles?"). |
| sorting-game.html | **Drag-and-Drop Sorting Game** – users drag waste items (banana peels, plastic, bottles, etc.) into colored bins. High scores are saved locally and submitted to the server to earn coins. |
| quiz-game.html | **Quiz Game** – configurable multiple-choice quiz generated by Groq API. Users answer questions on recycling topics, earn coins based on high scores. |
| shop.html | **Shop Page** – displays purchasable TAGS (cosmetic items) in a grid with rarity colors. Users spend coins earned from games to purchase tags. |
| style.css | **Global Stylesheet** – modern, polished design system with CSS variables (primary green #2E7D32, fonts Poppins/Outfit, animations, responsive layout). Applied across all pages. |
| script.js | **Client-side Logic** – handles authentication flows, navigation animations, profile coin display, page transitions, and fetches user stats from the server. |
| data.js | **API Configuration** – defines the API base URL (`window.API.base = '/api'`) used by client pages to communicate with the backend. |

### **Backend Files**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| server.js | **Express Server** � handles all API endpoints (auth, user stats, scoring, tags, DIY suggestions, quiz generation). Uses Groq API for AI features. Serves static frontend files and manages sessions with express-session. |
| users.json | **User Database** � stores user accounts (username, hashed password), coins, owned tags, and high scores per game. File-based persistence (demo only; replace with real DB for production). |

### **Asset Files**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| logo.png | **Site Logo** � displayed in the navigation bar next to "EcoWaste" site name. |

##  API Endpoints

All endpoints are prefixed with /api/:

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| POST | /signup | Create a new user account |
| POST | /login | Authenticate and start session |
| POST | /logout | End session |
| GET | /me | Get current logged-in user |
| GET | /user-stats | Fetch coins, owned tags, high scores |
| POST | /score | Submit game score, award coins on new high |

##  Key Metrics & Settings

- **Coin Award Formula**: loor(score / 10) coins per new high score
- **Tag Prices**: Range from 50 to 500 coins depending on rarity
- **Chart Colors**: Theme-based (primary green, accent orange, danger red)
- **Session Timeout**: Express session default (adjust in server.js as needed)

---

##  Notes

- **Demo-Only**: This project uses file-based user storage (users.json) and in-memory sessions. For production, integrate a real database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL) and a session store.
- **Security**: Passwords are hashed with crypt. For production, add HTTPS, CSRF protection, rate limiting, and better secret management.
- **Groq API**: Requires a valid API key. Free tier available at https://console.groq.com. Models may be decommissioned; check the console for available models.
- **CORS**: Currently allows credentials on same-origin requests. Adjust in server.js for cross-origin deployments.

##  Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"Groq API key not configured"** | Set `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 before running 
ode server.js |
| **"Invalid API Key"** | Verify your Groq API key is correct and active (get new one from https://console.groq.com/keys) |
| **Dropdown games text not visible** | CSS updated; text color is now darker (--primary-dark). Clear browser cache if issue persists. |
| **Charts not animating** | Ensure style.css is loaded; check browser console for JS errors. |
| **Quiz/DIY suggester returns errors** | Check server terminal for Groq API response; model may be decommissioned. Try $env:GROQ_MODEL = 'mixtral-8x7b-32768' or another available model. |
